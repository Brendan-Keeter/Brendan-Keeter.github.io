The ESP32 that I have selected contains enough pins to be able to safely and effectively organize the board without crowding. Another thing about the board is the applications it is commonly used in. This ESP module is commonly used in sound recognition and audio devices which would suit well for the project we are working on that involves a microphone. The maximum current in the board is well within the parameters that we intend to keep our components under, so there is very little risk of damage to the EPS32 module and its recommended voltage is the exact same as the voltage we intended to use for our project. This microcontroller also has enough UART's for the project as multiple UART's are needed.
