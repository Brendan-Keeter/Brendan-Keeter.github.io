### Product choice for Voltage regulator: Product 1
The Texas Instruments IC REG BUCK 3.3V 1.7A 8SOIC voltage regulator is a powerful voltage regulator that works well within the parameters of my project. With the wall mount supplying power, it will successfully be able to regulator the voltage while sending the most amount of current into the system as well. The size of the regulator is small, however the datasheet offers a guide on how to successfully solder the surface mount voltage regulator. The price point for this voltage regulator is very good as well as it is only $1.60 for each part, this allows for the option to get the ones I would need for my project and then multiple extras in case of an issue with the part occurs.

## LED Array
The LED array is important as it allows for a physical signal that the Wifi module is working and that the product is on.

### Product choice for LED Array: Product 3
The W端rth Elektronik LED GREEN CLEAR 0603 SMD is the choice I ended up going with as, while it only comes in green, it is very powerful and long lasting. Its datasheet contains a lot of useful information on it on how to solder it and how to get different intensities of light from it, something that the other datasheets for LED's had lacked. It is very easy to solder and use for a PCB board as well.

### Role of Subsystem
For the team, this subsystems role is to allow communication inputs from Wifi and Bluetooth. By gathering these inputs, this subsystem will then send data to the other subsystems of the project to physically perform the action selected. Once the data has been processed by the other subsystems, it will once again be received by this subsystem and sent back out via Wifi to the user.

The main focus of this subsystems responsibilities are sensing, display, and communication. For my subsystem, it will be responsible for sensing a button press from a user over Wifi or Bluetooth connection. As it receives this data, it will display something onto their device to allow them to see more information about what the project will be physically demonstrating. The main importance of this subsystem is communication. As the subsystem recieves inputs from the user, it is sending and recieving data to and from the other subsystems in order to physically demonstrate whichever option the user had selected.

### Microcontroller Choice Statement
The EPS32 module that I had found is well suited for this project. The ESP32 that I have selected contains enough pins to be able to safely and effectively organize the board without crowding. Another thing about the board is the applications it is commonly used in. This ESP module is commonly used in sound recognition and audio devices which would suit well for the project we are working on that involves a microphone. The maximum current in the board is well within the parameters that we intend to keep our components under, so there is very little risk of damage to the EPS32 module and its recommended voltage is the exact same as the voltage we intended to use for our project. This microcontroller also has enough UART's for the project as multiple UART's are needed. This extra UART may be able to help with the debugging process as the code is being designed for this project.
